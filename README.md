Description
The application allows the management of dissertation requests.

The platform is based on a Single Page Application web architecture accessible in a desktop browser, on mobile devices, or tablets (considering user preferences).
Functionalities:

- The application has two types of users, students and professors.
- A professor has a series of enrollment sessions that cannot overlap.
- Within an enrollment session, a student can submit a preliminary request to a professor.
- The professor can approve the student's request within a predefined limit.
- The professor can also reject the request with a justification.
- A student can submit requests to multiple professors, but if approved by one, the request cannot be approved by another.
- After the preliminary request is approved, the student can upload a file (the signed request).
- In response to the request, the professor can upload a file or reject the request, in which case the student will need to submit a new request.
